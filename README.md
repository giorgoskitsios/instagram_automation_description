# Instagram Automation Description

## Attention
I made this repo just so I can describe what I built. Unfortunately the actual code repo is not publicly available but you can always request access.

# Description
This python application can scrape instagram users and add them to a csv. Then the user can open it with excel and and specify certain actions he would like to be done with each user by adding the acction to the corresponding columns. For example the bot can follow the user, send a message or send a photo or a link. The project was built with selenium and pandas library and it can be drastically improved thanks to the advancements in Generative AI that have taken place since I built the project.
